## About

The Social API is an API made using mongoose and express, this was defenitley one of the more challenging projects but witht his project you are able to run CRUD and help you do things like

 GET and GET All Users and Thought

 UPDATE a User and a Thought

 POST a Thought, Reaction, a Friend and User

 finally DELETE a User, Friend, and Thought

 ## Complications

 Some of the complications I ran into were due to naming conventions, how to name my folders , and how to get my data in the API but sending the data and seeing what errors I get in my Terminal and Insomnia errors
